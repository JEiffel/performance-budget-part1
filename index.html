	                    <p>Cylburn Arboretum is a 200-acre public garden and nature preserve. Wander through 3 miles of spectacular trails that wind through a mature piedmont forest. Enjoy a variety of gardens, such as a formal garden, woodland gardens and shady gardens. Seasonal gardens include displays of roses, daylilies, dahlias and annuals. </p>



                     <p>Take a step back in time with a visit to Cylburn’s Mansion. In the 1860s, George Frederick, the architect of City Hall, designed this Renaissance Revival-style home. Constructed of gneiss from the local Bare Hills quarry, the mansion is surrounded by 15 strikingly impressive tree and shrub collections.</p><br><br><br>

						<p>The Rawlings Conservatory greenhouses are in distinct climates that allow for the display of plants from all over the world. The Conservatory introduces the world’s flora to visitors who may experience the plants in conditions close to their natural environments.</p>

<p>The mild Mediterranean greenhouse replicates the dry summers and foggy winters of the Mediterranean basin and southern California. The Tropical Forest greenhouse displays plants that originate in the tropics,  including those native to parts of Africa, Asia, the Americas, Australia, and some tropical islands. The Desert greenhouse showcases plants that can endure the harsh, windy, and arid conditions of the desert where daytime temperatures can climb as high as 125 degrees Fahrenheit and fall as low as 10 degrees at night, with little rainfall. The Orchid Room features the largest of all the plant groups, which includes over 30,000 species and more than 100,000 registered hybrids. The Palm House grants the visitor an opportunity to return to the Victorian era.</p>



<p>Established in 1888 as the Druid Hill Conservatory, the Howard P. Rawlings Conservatory has grown from the original Palm House and Orchid Room to include three greenhouses, two display pavilions, and outdoor gardens.</p>



<p>The mission of the Rawlings Conservatory & Botanic Gardens is to foster an appreciation and understanding of plants from around the world and the vital roles they play in our lives.</p><br><br><br>

						<p>Patterson Park is frequented by neighborhood schools and churches for its athletic fields and is home to one of the two ice rinks available in the city. Two important architectural features of the Park included the boat house (1864, now extinct) and the pagoda (1891). Other architecture in the park reflected a number of styles, including Italian Villa, Gothic Revival, Exotic Revival and Romanesqe Revival that were designed to create an “eclectic” scene of images that would free visitors from the stresses of urban life</p>

<p>Patterson remains most significant in that it is Baltimore's most intensively used large park and remains an outstanding example of 19th century park design. The site is surrounded by extensive rowhouse neighborhoods that rely solely on this park for open space.</p>

<p>The Friends of Patterson Park is an active community group that supports the park through fundraising, work and clean-up projects, and advocacy of the Patterson Park master plan, completed in 1998.</p><br><br><br>
